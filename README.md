# Los paquetes van a CRAN

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to contain the slides explaining how to submit your package to CRAN and maintain it there. 
The slides are in Spanish.

This is an expansion of the previous [talk I gave in useR2021](https://llrs.dev/talk/user-2021/).
This presentation includes information from current state of CRAN packages and a look on the archives for the time between updates.
